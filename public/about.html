<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Originally from Pittsbugh, Pa, I joined the Unites States Air Force at an early age.  
  I liked it so much, I stayed for 25 years, 8 months and 2 days.  
  </p>
  <p>Retiring with a graduate degree, I taught college for 14 years before choosing my 
  current career in real estate. Each of my chosen professions has been one focused on helping others.
In my current role, helping folks find homes, where they can build equity and generational wealth, is very gratifying. </p>
